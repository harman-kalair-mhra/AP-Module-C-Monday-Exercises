# AP-Module-C-Monday-Exercises

This repository includes challenges presented on Monday. C++ is the chosen langauge for this 'Advance Programming' Module. Replit link has been provided on each file.

## 1: Quote a Quote
This C++ program prompts the user for a quote and then for an author. Consider the following format example:

```
What is the quote? The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.
Who said it? Walt Disney
Walt Disney says: “The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.”
```

## 2: Temperature Conversion
This C++ program converts temperatures from Fahrenheit to Centigrade and Centigrade to Fahrenheit based on the user’s input. This program will prompt the user for a starting
temperature followed by a which type of conversion then perform the conversion.
The formulas are:
```
C = (F -32) * 5 / 9
F = (C x 9 / 5) + 32
```

## PRIMER: Number Guesser:
C++ ‘guess the number’ game supports three levels of difficulty; level 1 is limited to numbers 1-10, level 2 is limited to numbers 1-100 and level 3 is limited to numbers 1-1000. Prompt the user to select a difficulty level before the game begins. The program picks a random number and prompts the player to ‘guess’; each time the player ‘guesses’ the program should provide a hint (e.g., too low, too high). The program logs the number of guesses and once correct tells the player how many attempts were made before asking them to ‘play again’.

Example Format shown below:
```
Let’s play ‘Guess the Number’
Please pick a difficulty level (1, 2 or 3)? 1
Great, I have randomly picked a number in the range 1 - 10

What’s your guess? 5
Too low, guess again: 8
Too high, guess again: 7

Well done, the number was 7 – you got it in 3 guesses
Do you want to play again (Y/N)? N
No problem, see you later.
```

## PRIMER: Self Service Checkout:
Simple C++ Self-Service Checkout program. This program allows the user to enter the quantity and price of the items. A simple calculation has been used to workout the Shopping Tax.

```
Shopping Tax: 5.5%
```
Example output structure:

```
Please enter a quantity for item 1 (or 0 to finish): 3
Please enter item 1 cost: 0.99

Please enter a quantity for item 2 (or 0 to finish): 2
Please enter item 2 cost: 1.50

Please enter a quantity for item 3 (or 0 to finish): 1
Please enter item 2 cost: 2.99

Please enter a quantity for item 3 (or 0 to finish): 0
Thank you.

Subtotal: £8.96
Shopping Tax: £0.49

Total: £9.45
